# Get started

This guide will instruct you through:

- Writing a class that defines a Durable Object.
- Instantiating and communicationg with a Durable Object from another Worker via the Fetch API.
- Uploading the Durable Object and Worker to Cloudflare's servers using Wrangler. 


## Prerequisites

Enable Durable Objects for your account by purchasing the Workers Paid plan:

 1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
 2. Go to **Workers & Pages** > **Plans**. 
 3. Select **Purchase Workers Paid** and complete the payment process to enable Durable Objects.

 ## 1. Write a class to define a Durable Object

Before you create and access a Durable Object, you must define its behavior by exporting an ordinary JavaScript class. 

{{<Aside type="note">}}
If you do not use JavaScript, you will need a [shim](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shim) to translate your class definition to a JavaScript class.
{{</Aside>}}

Your class will have a constructor with two parameters. The first parameter, `state`, passed to the class constructor contains state specific to the Durable Object, including methods for accessing storage. The second parameter, `env`, contains any bindings you have associated with the Worker when you uploaded it. 

Note that this means bindings are no longer global variables. For example, if you had a secret binding `MY_SECRET`, you must access it as `env.MY_SECRET`.

```js
export class DurableObjectExample {
  constructor(state, env) {}
}
```
Workers communicate with a Durable Object via the fetch API. Like a Worker, a Durable Object listens for incoming fetch events by registering an event handler. For a Durable Object, the fetch handler is defined as a method on the class.

```js
export class DurableObjectExample {
  constructor(state, env) {}

  async fetch(request) {
    return new Response("Hello World");
  }
}
```

A Worker can pass information to a Durable Object via headers, the HTTP method, the Request body, or the Request URI.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

HTTP requests received by a Durable Object do not come directly from the Internet. They come from other Worker code â€“ possibly other Durable Objects, or Workers. Durable Objects use HTTP for familiarity, but plan to introduce other protocols in the future.

{{</Aside>}}

## 2. Configure Durable Object bindings

Configure Durable Object [bindings](/workers/platform/bindings/) in the `wrangler.toml` by providing the class name and script name whose objects you wish to access using the binding. The script name can be omitted when creating a binding for a class that is defined in the same Worker as the binding.

```toml
[durable_objects]
bindings = [
  { name = "EXAMPLE_CLASS", class_name = "DurableObjectExample" } # Binding to our DurableObjectExample class
]
```

The `[durable_objects]` section has one subsection called `bindings`, which is an array of tables. 

Each table contains the following fields:

  - `name` - Required. The binding name to use within your Worker.
  - `class_name` - Required. The class name you wish to bind to.
  - `script_name` - Optional. Defaults to the current [environment's](/workers/wrangler/environments/) script.

If you are using Wrangler [environments](/workers/wrangler/environments/), you must specify any Durable Object bindings you wish to use on a per-environment basis. 

Durable Object bindings are not inherited. For example, you can define an environment named `staging` as below:

```toml
[env.staging]
durable_objects.bindings = [
  {name = "EXAMPLE_CLASS", class_name = "DurableObjectExample"}
]
```

Because Wrangler appends the [environment name](/workers/wrangler/environments/) to the top-level name when publishing, for a Worker named `worker-name` the above example is equivalent to:

```toml
[env.staging]
durable_objects.bindings = [
  {name = "EXAMPLE_CLASS", class_name = "DurableObjectExample", script_name = "worker-name-staging"}
]
```

`"EXAMPLE_CLASS"` in the staging environment is bound to a different script name compared to the top-level `"EXAMPLE_CLASS"` binding, and will therefore access different objects with different persistent storage. 

If you want an environment-specific binding that accesses the same objects as the top-level binding, specify the top-level script name explicitly:

```toml
[env.another]
durable_objects.bindings = [
  {name = "EXAMPLE_CLASS", class_name = "DurableObjectExample", script_name = "worker-name"}
]
```

Refer to [Bindings](/workers/platform/bindings/) for more information about bindings.

## 3. Configure Durable Object classes with migrations

Migrations are performed through the `[[migrations]]` configurations key in your `wrangler.toml` file.  

Migrations require a migration tag, which is defined by the `tag` property in each migration entry. 

Migration tags are treated like unique names and are used to determine which migrations have already been applied. Once a given script has a migration tag set on it, all future script uploads must include a migration tag.

The migration list is an ordered array of tables, specified as a top-level key in your `wrangler.toml` file. The migration list is inherited by all environments and cannot be overridden by a specific environment.

All migrations are applied at deployment. Each migration can only be applied once per [environment](/workers/wrangler/environments/).

To illustrate an example migrations workflow, the `DurableObjectExample` class can be initially defined with:

```toml
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1" # Should be unique for each entry
new_classes = ["DurableObjectExample"] # Array of new classes
```
## 4. Instantiate and communicate with a Durable Object

Durable Objects do not receive requests directly from the Internet. Durable Objects receive requests from Workers or other Durable Objects. 

This is achieved by configuring a binding in the calling Worker for each Durable Object class that you would like it to be able to talk to. These bindings must be configured at upload time. Methods exposed by the binding can be used to communicate with particular Durable Object instances.

A Worker talks to a Durable Object through a [stub](/durable-objects/learning/create-durable-object-stubs/). 

The class binding's `get()` method returns a stub to the particular Durable Object instance, and the stub's `fetch()` method sends HTTP [requests](/workers/runtime-apis/request/) to the instance.


### Example of the fetch handler implementation

The fetch handler in the example below implements the Worker that communicates to the Durable Object.  


ES Modules differ from regular JavaScript files in that they have imports and exports. For example, [to write a class that defines a Durable Object](/durable-objects/get-started/#1-write-a-class-to-define-a-durable-object), you use `export class DurableObjectExample`. To implement a fetch handler, export a method named `fetch()` in an `export default {}` block.


```js
// In modules-syntax workers, you use `export default` to export your script's
// main event handlers, such as the `fetch` handler for receiving HTTP
// requests. In Service workers, the fetch handler was registered using
// `addEventHandler("fetch", event => { ... })`; this is just new syntax for
// essentially the same thing.
export default {
  // In modules-syntax workers, bindings are delivered as a property of the
  // environment object passed as the second parameter when an event handler or
  // class constructor is invoked. This is new compared to Service Module workers,
  // in which bindings show up as global variables.
  async fetch(request, env) {
    // Derive an object ID from the URL path. `EXAMPLE_CLASS` is the Durable
    // Object binding that you will read how to configure in the next section.
    // `EXAMPLE_CLASS.idFromName()` always returns the same ID when given the
    // same string as input (and called on the same class), but never the same
    // ID for two different strings (or for different classes). So, in this
    // case, you are creating a new object for each unique path.
    let id = env.EXAMPLE_CLASS.idFromName(new URL(request.url).pathname);

    // Construct the stub for the Durable Object using the ID. A stub is a
    // client object used to send messages to the Durable Object.
    let stub = env.EXAMPLE_CLASS.get(id);

    // Forward the request to the Durable Object. Note that `stub.fetch()` has
    // the same signature as the global `fetch()` function, except that the
    // request is always sent to the object, regardless of the request's URL.
    //
    // The first time you send a request to a new object, the object will be
    // created for us. If you do not store durable state in the object, it will
    // automatically be deleted later (and recreated if you request it again).
    // If you do store durable state, then the object may be evicted from memory
    // but its durable state will be kept around permanently.
    let response = await stub.fetch(request);

    // You received an HTTP response back. You could process it in the usual
    // ways, but in this case, you will just return it to the client.
    return response;
  },
};
```

In the example above, you used a string-derived object ID by calling the `idFromName()` function on the binding. You can also ask the system to generate random unique IDs. System-generated unique IDs have better performance characteristics, but require you to store the ID somewhere to access the Object again later. 

Refer to [Access a Durable Object from a Worker](/durable-objects/learning/access-durable-object-from-a-worker/) to  learn more about communicating to a Durable Object.

## 5. Upload a Durable Object Worker

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Custom Wrangler installation instructions">}}

You must use [Wrangler version 1.19.3 or greater](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) to manage Durable Objects.

{{</Aside>}}

To upload Workers that implement or bind to Durable Objects, use [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/), the Workers CLI. Start with one of our templates, the simplest of which can be used by running:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-template
$ cd durable-objects-template
$ wrangler dev
```

The template will create a directory for your project with basic configuration and a single JavaScript source file already set up. Try the [Durable Objects Rollup ES Modules template](https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-rollup-esm) if you want to use the ES modules, the [Durable Objects TypeScript Rollup ES Modules template](https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-typescript-rollup-esm) if you want to use TypeScript, or the [Durable Objects Webpack CommonJS template](https://github.com/cloudflare/durable-objects-webpack-commonjs) if you want to bundle external dependencies with your code using Rollup or Webpack.

The following sections will cover how to customize the configuration, but you can also immediately publish the generated project using the [`wrangler deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/) command.

### Specify the main module

Workers that use ES Modules syntax must have a main module specified from which all Durable Objects and event handlers are exported. The file that should be treated as the main module is configured using the `"main"` key in the `[build.upload]` section of `wrangler.toml`. 

Refer to [Custom builds documentation](/workers/wrangler/custom-builds/) for more details.


### Durable Object migrations through Wrangler CLI

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Deprecation Notice">}}

While CLI migrations initially served as a way to quickly migrate Durable Objects, this method is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

{{</Aside>}}

It is possible to define a migration purely through extra arguments to the `wrangler deploy` command. When taking this route, any migrations listed in the `wrangler.toml` configuration file are ignored.

You should provide an `--old-tag` value whenever possible. This value should be the name of the migration tag that you believe to be most recently active. Your `wrangler deploy` command will throw an error if your `--old-tag` expectation does not align with Cloudflare's value.

The list of CLI migration arguments that can be added to `wrangler deploy` is as follows:

```bash
--old-tag <tag name> # Optional if your script does not have a migration tag set yet.
--new-tag <tag name> # new-tag and old-tag are optional if you only use CLI migrations.

# Each of the migration directives can be specified multiple times if you are
# creating/deleting/renaming/transferring multiple classes at once.
--new-class <class name>
--delete-class <class name>
--rename-class <from class> <to class>
--transfer-class <from script> <from class> <to class>
```

## 6. Test your Durable Objects project

If you copy the `DurableObjectExample` and fetch handler code from above into a generated Wrangler project, publish it using a `--new-class` migration, and make a request to it, you will notice that your request was stored in a Durable Object:

```sh
$ curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" https://<worker-name>.<your-namespace>.workers.dev/ --data "important data!"
***.***.***.*** stored important data!
```
