## Structure

## Required components

[Title](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/titles/) - Short verb phrase in second-person imperative. Do not use gerund phrases. 

[Steps](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/steps-tasks-procedures/) - Numbered steps that complete a task.

[Next steps](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/next-steps/) - What users should see as the end result of the steps and/or actionable next steps. Refer to Next steps for more information.

## Optional components

[Context](/style-guide/content-strategy/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/context/) - An introductory paragraph on the following steps and what they'll accomplish. Refer to Context for more information. 

Provide context to the reader that is not in the section heading.

End with a colon or a period. Use a colon if it immediately precedes the steps. Use a period if there's more material (such as a note) between the context and the procedure.

Don't provide context for steps with a partial sentence that's completed by the numbered steps.
