## General guidelines


## Additional information

Use complete sentences.

Use parallel structure.

Use second person imperative. Refer to the Style Guide for guidance on when to use certain verbs (click, select, choose, etc). 

For an optional step, type (Optional) as the first word of the step.

For example: (Optional) Type an arbitrary string, to be delivered to the target address with each notification delivered over this channel.

Don't include keyboard shortcuts.

Don't use directional language to orient the reader, such as above, below, or right-hand side. This type of language doesn't work well for accessibility or for localization. If a UI element is hard to find, provide a screenshot.

Use sentences like "The <screen/page/card> displays." wisely.

Usually, you only need this kind of helper sentence if the user ended up in an unexpected location, or if there was more than one possible target location, depending on the options that the user selected.

As an alternative, consider adding the <screen/page/card> mention at the beginning of the next step: "5. In <screen/page/card>, select Save."
